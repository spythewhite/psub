In order to (currently) use @apl{psub}, simply load @file{psub.P} in
@apl{XSB}:

@begin{verbatim}
	|?- [psub].
@end{verbatim}

@noindent
and then load your XSB source file:

@begin{verbatim}
	|?- [foo].
@end{verbatim}

@noindent
Your source file will then be type checked, and an appropriate message
will be printed out, depending on whether the program was well-typed,
or ill-typed.
